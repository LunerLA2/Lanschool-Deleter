# Lanschool-Deleter
A repository offering methods to completely remove LanSchool from your Windows PC.

## Why?
Because privacy matters. Schools have no business monitoring your activity on a personal device. It's invasive, unethical, and poses a security risk. Plus, LanSchool is riddled with Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
